You can use the following login for testing :  
User : admin@twyrael.fr  
Pass : twyrael123

The site may be a bit slow because of the database that is hosted by a free provider (db4free.net).

## How to run :
- clone the project
- go to the folder you just downloaded (twyrael)
- open a terminal and enter : 
```
$ composer install
```
You can now run the site with :
```
$ ./bin/console server:run
```
